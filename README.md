# deep-mir-cut datasets

This repository contains the following datasets:
* [mir_dataset.txt] - The full dataset of extended sequences
* [trainSet.txt] - The train set
* [validationSet.txt] - The validation set
* [testSet.txt] - The test set

If you'd like to generate these datasets yourself, the Dataset_Download_Folder contains scripts which will download and put together the extended sequence set, and the DeepMirCut_TrainTestSet_Generation folder has scripts which were used to generate the train, test, and validation sets.
